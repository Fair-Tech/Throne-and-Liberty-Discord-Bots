# FairTech's Throne and Liberty Discord Bots
Discord Bots for Displaying Time, Weather, and Event cycles as Bot Users custom Status' in your Discord Server.

## Features
- 3 Separate Bots with custom status that update every 5 seconds, displaying the current Weather, Time, and Upcoming Events

- Region/Server Changes via Command

- Supports all Throne and Liberty Servers, Global (Amazon Games) and Korea (NCSoft)


More Features Coming Soon..


### Functionality
Uses HTTP Post requests to access hidden 'API' from [GamesLantern.com](https://throneandliberty.gameslantern.com) to fetch Weather, Event, and Time of Day Cycles. 
The bot's status updates every 5 seconds to act as a countdown until the next cycle. 

I originally wanted to use a timer similar to how tracks count down with the spotify rich presence, but it doesn't seem like those functions are publicly available in the Discord SDK.
